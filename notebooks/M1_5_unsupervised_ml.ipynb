This is the first principal component, the straight line that shows the most substantial variance in the data.\n",

Each principal component sums up a certain percentage of the total variation in the dataset. Where your initial variables are strongly correlated with one another, you will be able to approximate most of the complexity in your dataset with just a few principal components. Usually, the first principal component captures the main similarity in your data, the second the main difference.\n",

        "\n",
        "These principal components can be computed via **Eigenvalues** and **Eigenvectors**. Just like many things in life, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues come in pairs: every eigenvector has a corresponding eigenvalue. Simply put, an eigenvector is a direction, such as \"vertical\" or \"45 degrees\", while an eigenvalue is a number telling you how much variance there is in the data in that direction. The eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue is, therefore, the first principal component. The number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that exits is equal to the number of dimensions the data set has. Consequently, we can reframe a dataset in terms of these eigenvectors and eigenvalues without changing the underlying information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that reframing a dataset regarding a set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors does not entail changing the data itself, you're just looking at it from a different angle, which should represent the data better.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Clustering\n",
        "Clustering can be broadly divided into two subgroups:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hard clustering:** in hard clustering, each data object or point either belongs to a cluster completely or not. For example in the Uber dataset, each location belongs to either one borough or the other.\n",
        "2. **Soft clustering:** in soft clustering, a data point can belong to more than one cluster with some probability or likelihood value. For example, you could identify some locations as the border points belonging to two or more boroughs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clustering algorithms can also be categorized based on their **cluster model**, that is based on how they form clusters or groups. This tutorial only highlights some of the prominent clustering algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Connectivity-based clustering:** the main idea behind this clustering is that data points that are closer in the data space are more related (similar) than to data points farther away. The clusters are formed by connecting data points according to their distance. At different distances, different clusters will form and can be represented using a dendrogram, which gives away why they are also commonly called **hierarchical clustering**. These methods do not produce a unique partitioning of the dataset, rather a hierarchy from which the user still needs to choose appropriate clusters by choosing the level where they want to cluster. Note: They are also not very robust towards outliers, which might show up as additional clusters or even cause other clusters to merge.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Centroid-based clustering:** in this type of clustering, clusters are represented by a central vector or a centroid. This centroid might not necessarily be a member of the dataset. This is an iterative clustering algorithms in which the notion of similarity is derived by how close a data point is to the centroid of the cluster. **k-means** is a centroid based clustering, and will you see this topic more in detail later on in the tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Distribution-based clustering:** this clustering is very closely related to statistics: distributional modeling. Clustering is based on the notion of how probable is it for a data point to belong to a certain distribution, such as the Gaussian distribution, for example. Data points in a cluster belong to the same distribution. These models have a strong theoritical foundation, however they often suffer from overfitting. Gaussian mixture models, using the expectation-maximization algorithm is a famous distribution based clustering method.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Density-based methods:** search the data space for areas of varied density of data points. Clusters are defined as areas of higher density within the data space compared to other regions. Data points in the sparse areas are usually considered to be noise and/or border points. The drawback with these methods is that they expect some kind of density guide or parameters to detect cluster borders. `DBSCAN` and `OPTICS` are some prominent density based clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, what is the best to use? Hard to say. Clustering is an subjective task and there can be more than one correct clustering algorithm. Every algorithm follows a different set of rules for defining the 'similarity' among data points. The most appropriate clustering algorithm for a particular problem often needs to be chosen experimentally, unless there is a mathematical reason to prefer one clustering algorithm over another. An algorithm might work well on a particular dataset but fail for a different kind of dataset. Since there is most times no wrong or right, the clustering that delivers the most useful results is the way to go.\n",
        "\n",
        "## K-means Clustering\n",
        "K-means clustering is the most commonly used unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dividing a given dataset into `k` clusters, which must be provided by the user. The basic idea behind k-means clustering consists of defining clusters so that the total intra-cluster variation (known as total within-cluster variation) is minimized. There are several k-means algorithms available. However, the standard algorithm defines the total within-cluster variation as the sum of squared distances Euclidean distances between items and the corresponding centroid. Its an iterative process containing the following steps\n",
        "\n",

        "4. Then it recomputes the distance between the new cluster and the old ones and stores them in a new distance matrix.\n",

        "* **Single-linkage:** calculates the minimum distance between the clusters before merging. This linkage may be used to detect high values in your dataset which may be outliers as they will be merged at the end.\n",
        "* **Average-linkage:** calculates the average distance between clusters before merging.\n",
        "* **Centroid-linkage:** finds centroid of cluster 1 and centroid of cluster 2, and then calculates the distance between the two before merging (hint: usually not a good idea).\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of linkage method entirely depends on you and there is no hard and fast method that will always give you good results. Different linkage methods lead to different clusters.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Data on different scales can cause undesirable resultsin clustering methods\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Distance used:** Hierarchical clustering can virtually handle any distance metric while k-means rely on euclidean distances.\n",
        "* **Stability of results:** k-means requires a random step at its initialization that may yield different results if the process is re-run. That wouldn't be the case in hierarchical clustering.\n",
        "* **Number of Clusters:** While you can use elbow plots, Silhouette plot etc. to figure the right number of clusters in k-means, hierarchical too can use all of those but with the added benefit of leveraging the dendrogram for the same.\n",
        "* **Computation Complexity:** K-means is less computationally expensive than hierarchical clustering and can be run on large datasets within a reasonable time frame, which is the main reason k-means is more popular.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Note: Measuring Godness-of-Fit in clusters\n",
        "Perhaps the most important part in any unsupervised learning task is the analysis of the results. After you have performed the clustering using any algorithm and any sets of parameters you need to make sure that you did it right. But how do you determine that?\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, there are many measures to do this, perhaps the most popular one is the Dunn's Index. Dunn's index is the ratio between the minimum inter-cluster distances to the maximum intra-cluster diameter. The diameter of a cluster is the distance between its two furthermost points. In order to have well separated and compact clusters you should aim for a higher Dunn's index.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, graphical inspection often helps comparing the results of different algorithms and poarameters. [Here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dendextend/vignettes/Cluster_Analysis.html) you find some advanced diagnostic visualizations for hirarchical clustering.\n",
